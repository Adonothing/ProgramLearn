The pulse per second (PPS) signal from GNSS receiver is commonly used as the benchmark for time synchronization with other sensors, which is crucial for the accuracy of the sensor integration. Therefore, the timing quality of the PPS signal is important and worthy to be evaluated comprehensively. We use a chip scale cesium atomic clock to evaluate the PPS quality of three popular commercial GNSS receivers. A practical evaluation method is proposed, which can mitigate the systematic error of the reference clock effectively. The PPS interval stabilities are evaluated by Allan variance to reflect the PPS time offset, and the clock divergences during GNSS signal loss are measured to reflect the capability to maintain the clock accuracy. The test results show that with nominal GNSS satellite signal condition, the standard deviations of the PPS intervals are in the order of 10E-8 s, and the maximum clock offset after 10 min of losing lock is at microsecond level. The qualities of the PPS signal from the tested receivers are sufficient for the time synchronization of the integrated navigation systems.},

  abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) provides outstanding positioning services for outdoor activities with sufficient accuracies, but it has poor indoor performance. Indeed, indoor positioning is also expected to achieve the outdoor positioning level to cater to an even higher volume of user demands. A pseudolite (PL), also called a pseudosatellite, is a ground-based positioning system that offers flexible deployment and accurate “orbits”. The PL system can carry on the role of the GNSS to provide precise positioning for indoor users. The clock differences originating from ground-based transmitters cause unsynchronized timing issues and impede attempts to fix the integer ambiguity. Numerous studies have been conducted with an emphasis on time synchronization to obtain this ambiguity-fixed solution by employing multiple transceivers in transmitter-receiver combinations for self-calibration inside a regional network of the ground-based system. However, this process requires a large investment and complicates the positioning owing to its intricate implementation. Actually, time synchronization can easily be achieved with a transmitter-only PL system at a low cost once the clock bias between transmitters is properly handled. Thus, we propose and present indoor precise point positioning (iPPP) and indoor PPP-real-time kinematic (iPPP-RTK) to handle the PL clock bias efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that the transmitter-only PL system can be time-synchronized without high cost or complicated operations and that centimeter level indoor precise positioning can be reliably achieved with our proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Robust and accurate pose estimation is crucial for many applications in mobile robotics. Extending visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with other modalities such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU) can boost robustness and accuracy. However, for a tight sensor fusion, accurate time synchronization of the sensors is often crucial. Changing exposure times, internal sensor filtering, multiple clock sources and unpredictable delays from operation system scheduling and data transfer can make sensor synchronization challenging. In this paper, we present VersaVIS, an Open Versatile Multi-Camera Visual-Inertial Sensor Suite aimed to be an efficient research platform for easy deployment, integration and extension for many mobile robotic applications. VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering. The sensor suite supports a wide range of cameras and IMUs to match the requirements of the application. The synchronization accuracy of the framework is evaluated on multiple experiments achieving timing accuracy of less than 1 ms. Furthermore, the applicability and versatility of the sensor suite is demonstrated in multiple applications including visual-inertial SLAM, multi-camera applications, multimodal mapping, reconstruction and object based mapping.},
